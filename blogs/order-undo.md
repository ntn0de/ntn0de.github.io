# Announcing Order Undo: Now Live on the Shopify App Store 🚀

I am thrilled to announce that **Order Undo** has officially launched on the Shopify App Store. This milestone represents months of design, development, and a commitment to solving one of the most persistent friction points in eCommerce: post-purchase anxiety.

## The Vision: Empowering Every Customer

We’ve all been there—hitting "Buy Now" and immediately realizing we selected the wrong size, used the wrong shipping address, or forgot that one crucial discount code. 

For most Shopify stores, fixing this requires a frantic email to customer support, hoping they see it before the warehouse ships the order. **Order Undo** changes that by giving the power back to the customer.

## What is Order Undo?

**Order Undo** is a conversion-recovery tool that adds a customizable "Undo" period directly to the Shopify Order Status page. It allows customers to:
*   **Cancel orders instantly** without waiting for support.
*   **Edit order details** to fix simple mistakes like addresses or quantities.
*   **Reduce support tickets** for merchants, allowing teams to focus on growth instead of cancellations.

## A Rigorous Journey to the App Store

Passing the Shopify App Store review is no small feat. The review process is famously thorough, ensuring that every app meets the highest standards for security, performance, and user experience. 

Passing this review on our first launch is a testament to the quality of the engineering and the value we’re bringing to the Shopify ecosystem.

## The Road Ahead

This launch is just the beginning. The feedback from our early users has already been incredible, helping us refine the experience for both merchants and shoppers. Our mission is clear: to make the "mistake-free" shopping experience a standard feature for every high-growth brand on Shopify.
