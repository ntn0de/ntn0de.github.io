# BlinkReminder 👀

A minimal, native macOS menu bar application designed to reduce digital eye strain. It gently reminds you to blink and look away from your screen every 20 minutes (following the 20-20-20 rule).

## Features

* **Menu Bar Workflow:** Runs unobtrusively in your menu bar.
* **Smart Overlay:** A full-screen, dimming overlay guides you through a 20-second break.
* **Pause/Resume:** Easily pause reminders during meetings or movies.
* **Customizable Intervals:** Choose from 20, 10, or 5-minute intervals.
* **Notification Mode:** Fallback to system notifications if you prefer not to use the overlay.
* **Motivations:** Randomly displayed motivations, you can choose from (Nepali, English, Hindi)

## Installation

### Option 1: Homebrew (Easiest)

You can install BlinkReminder directly from this repository:

```bash
brew tap ntn0de/blink-reminder https://github.com/ntn0de/blink-reminder
brew install --cask blink-reminder
```

### Updating

To update BlinkReminder to the latest version via Homebrew:

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade --cask blink-reminder
```

### Option 2: Build from Source

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ntn0de/blink-reminder.git
   cd blink-reminder
   ```

2. **Build the app:**
   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ```

3. **Install:** Move the app to your Applications folder (critical for notifications to work):
   ```bash
   mv BlinkReminder.app /Applications/
   ```

4. **Run:** Open `BlinkReminder` from your Applications folder.

## Usage

1. **Start the App:** You will see a small "eye" icon (👀) in your menu bar.
2. **Take a Break:** When the timer hits, a screen overlay will appear. Follow the breathing exercise and look away for 20 seconds.
3. **Pause:** Click the menu bar icon and select **Pause** to temporarily stop the timer.
4. **Settings:**
   * **Interval:** Change the frequency of breaks (default is 20 minutes).
   * **Use Screen Overlay:** Uncheck this to receive standard macOS notifications instead of the full-screen overlay.

## Troubleshooting

* **"App is damaged" or can't open:** Because this is a self-signed app, macOS might flag it. You can fix this by running:
  ```bash
  xattr -cr /Applications/BlinkReminder.app
  ```
  Alternatively, right-click and select **Open** the first time, or go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security** to allow it.

* **No Notifications:** Ensure the app is in the `/Applications` folder and that "BlinkReminder" is allowed in **System Settings > Notifications**.

## Source Code

The app is fully open source and available on GitHub:

* [View on GitHub](https://github.com/ntn0de/blink-reminder)
* [Latest Releases](https://github.com/ntn0de/blink-reminder/releases)
